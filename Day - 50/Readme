Break a Palindrome
üß© Problem Statement
Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters palindrome, replace exactly one character with any lowercase English letter so that:

The resulting string is not a palindrome, and

It is the lexicographically smallest string possible after exactly one character replacement.

Return the resulting string. If no such transformation is possible (e.g., the input string has only one character), return an empty string.

üîç Definitions
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than string b if, at the first position they differ, the character in a is smaller than the corresponding character in b.

‚úÖ Examples
Example 1:
Input: "abccba"
Output: "aaccba"
Explanation:
Several ways exist to break the palindrome, like "zbccba" or "abacba", but "aaccba" is the lexicographically smallest valid result.

Example 2:
Input: "a"
Output: ""
Explanation:
It's a single-character palindrome. Changing it to any other letter still results in a palindrome of length 1, so return an empty string.

üí° Approach: Greedy + Lexicographical Strategy
Edge Case Check:

If the string has only one character, return "" immediately since no single-letter change can break the palindrome property.

Iterate Through First Half:

A palindrome is symmetric. To break it with the least lexicographic change, try changing the first non-'a' character in the first half to 'a'.

This ensures the change is minimal and occurs as early as possible in the string (since earlier positions affect lexicographical order more).

Fallback Case:

If all characters in the first half are 'a', change the last character to 'b'.

This guarantees the string is no longer a palindrome and is still as small as possible lexicographically.

‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)
We iterate at most halfway through the string (O(n/2)), hence overall time is linear in terms of the string length.

Space Complexity: O(1)
We modify the input string in-place (if mutable), using no extra space proportional to the input size.
